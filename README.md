# Faals's Compacts for DIY SlimeVr!
With a goal to achieve the smallest 18650 Case. The Compact was created,
with rigid strap mounts and a no clue and screw design for FDM!
Snap!!! and the components hold each other snugglie fit in the Case.

|2|**Charging Board**|**[TP4056 Type C](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|3|**IMU**|**[MPU 6050](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|4|**Power Switches**|**[Switch SS22F32](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|5|**Batteries**|**[Battery 18650](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|6|**Diodes**|**[1N5817 diodes](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|7|**Resistors**|**[180K ohm resistors](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|
|8|**Straps**|**[50mm straps](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**|


50mm straps are recommended.
The Case is only compatible with USB Type C Charging Boards.
If you are unclear about the Wemos D1 mini version, check the pictures or animations in the [Assembly](https://github.com/Faals/Faals-s-Compacts-/edit/main/README.md#assembly) categorie to verify that you have the right version.

## Functions
This is the label system! Sleek, compact, nice looking, and easy to remember. The *red* part indicates the position of the tracker so it is easy to identify, what goes where.

![function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114385702/192364379-8ae1a264-76ac-4a53-a451-95ca29fc9b63.png)

But of course, this is just a basic idea of how to use it. Let your creativity flow and see how the **X** represents your body.
## Assembly

Great you are finished with the prints. Now we can assemble the case. Lay the **[Wemos D1 Mini](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** into the Base toghter with the **[TP4056 Type C](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** as showen in the picture.

![Top 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114385702/193576925-ed2203bb-c1c9-4207-a738-ce777c858bd9.png)

The **[Wemos D1 Mini](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** gets secured by the little corner through pressure applied between the corner (1) and the back extrusion in circles 2 and 3. Adjust the side of the corner (1) of the Wemos D1 Mini to fit in between, if needed. You can also isolate the middle part of the **[TP4056 Type C](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** if you want to.

Now we can mount the MPU 6050 on the step with some thin double-sided tape, which makes assembly and soldering easier but is not needed. Solder the parts together and rout the wires as flat as possible.

The **[Battery 18650](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** and the **[Switch SS22F32](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** have to be soldered with some cable slack to fit into the lid before connecting the cover with the base. Because of the form factor, there is no space for a battery tray. To solder the cables to the contacts of the **[Battery 18650](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**, they have to be scratched, so the solder holds. If your **[Battery 18650](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** varies in size you can make some changes or add a piece of sponge or any kind of nonconductive filler so that the battery sits in the cover tight.

For the Cover we have to put the **[Battery 18650](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** into it with the **[Switch SS22F32](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)**.
The **[Switch SS22F32](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/components-guide.html)** has to be modified a little bit. You have to take the flaps and three pins off. As seen in the picture below.

## Assambly animation coming soon!!!
